  <p id="toppage1">Who is Lahari Ramini?</p>
  <hr></hr>
  <p class="text">Lahari is currently a senior in high school. She lives with her parents and her older brother.<br>
                At school, Lahari is an editor for the newspaper, the Co-President of MNâ€™s TASSEL chapter, <br>
                and involved in competitve speech and the Mustang Mentoring Program. She has a passion for   <br>
                science, education, and new places, but she has no idea what she wants to be when she 'grows up'.<br>
                Outside of school, you will most likely find her procrastinating to an unhealthy extent, going <br>
                on long tirades about movements she advocates for, making overly sarcastic comments, expanding her<br>
                musical horizons, and dreaming of being a billionaire so that she can one day take a Food World Tour. </p>
