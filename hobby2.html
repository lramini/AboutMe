    <hr></hr>
    <p class="text"> I know that this title sounds a little odd, but by 'expressing ideas' I mean that I like finding ways to inform the world about things<br>
                    At school, I'm part of the school newspaper and forensics. Through these activities and other means, I have had an outlet to express<br>
                    my ideas since a young age. I've had the privilege of writing about things I've been passionate about through the school newspaper  <br>
                    and I have also had the privilege of speaking about things I'm passionate about through forensics.
